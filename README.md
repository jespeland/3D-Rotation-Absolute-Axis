This projects implements C++ to demonstrates how to create, rotate, and move a 3D object about the x, y, and z axis using the external library OpenGL. Before running 
the program ensure that the "freeglut.dll" file is copied into the cmake-build-debug folder if you are running windows. It can be found in the folder titled
freeglut-MinGW-3.0.0-1.p under "bin". There are two options one for x32 systems and one for x64 systems.
